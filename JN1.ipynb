It introduces Python API commands\nfor authentication using API key and prompt inferencing using WML API.\n\n**Note:** Notebook code generated using Prompt Lab will execute successfully.\nIf code is modified or reordered, there is no guarantee it will successfully execute.\nFor details, see: <a href=\"/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-prompt-save.html?context=wx\" target=\"_blank\">Saving your work in Prompt Lab as a notebook.</a>\n\nSome familiarity with Python is helpful.
